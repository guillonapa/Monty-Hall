# Monty_Hall

This is a small one-day project whose purpose was to practice some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript after I taught it to myself. I thought it would be cool to code a site where the famous Monty Hall game could be simulated. Here I also explain why it's probabilistically better to ALWAYS change doors after Monty Hall has shown you one of the "Goat Doors".

* The project can be seen at https://fierce-garden-61327.herokuapp.com/.
* Everything was coded from scratch, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
