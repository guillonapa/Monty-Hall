      <h1>INFO</h1>
      <p class="description_text"><i>Suppose you're on a game show with Monty Hall, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</i><br><br>The answer is YES! You can use this simulator to experiment if changing doors over a relatively large number of trials is a better choice than sticking to the same door.<br><br>Why? When you first select a door you have a 1/3 chance of choosing the right door. This means that there is a 2/3 chance that the right door is one of the other two. So... when Monty Hall reveals that there's a goat behind one of the doors (one that you didn't originally picked) the 2/3 chance is redistributed into a single door. So when you switch your choice you are increaseing your chances of winning the car by 1/3... now there is a 66.6% chance you win the car!</p>
