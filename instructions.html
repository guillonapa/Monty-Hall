    <p class="instructions_game">The Monty Hall problem is an interesting probability problem that can be easily explained with a game. The problem is named after the presenter of the TV show <i>Let's Make a Deal!</i>, Monty Hall. So... what are the rules to the game?</p>

      <p class="instructions_game">Imagine you are at a TV game show and the host, let's say Monty Hall, asks you to choose one of three doors. Behind one of these doors there is a brand new car, yet behind the other two there is a dissapointing goat. Now, after you make your pick Monty Hall will open one of the two doors that you did not pick and show you that there is a goat. He will then ask you if you want to change your original pick or not. Is it to your advantage to switch doors?</p>

      <p class="instructions_game">The answer is yes! Always change doors. If you think about it it's very simple. When you initially choose a door there is 1/3 chance that you pick the correct one, which means that there is a 2/3 chance that the brand new car is behind one of the two other doors. However, when Monty Hall opens a door (different to the one you picked) and reveals that behind such door is a goat the probability redistributes. In other words, after Monty Hall opens the door there will be a 2/3 chance that the car is behind the door that remains unopened and that you did not choose originally. The probability that the car is behind one the the two doors that you did not originally picked is still 2/3... but now you know for certain that behind of one of those doors there is a goat! Your chances of winning the car can increase by 33.3% if you change your original pick!</p>

      <p class="instructions_game">You can use this simulation to see what actually happens. The site allocates the car randomly behind the doors and you can make a first pick and a second pick after you are given a hint. Using the simulation you can see what happens when you never change your original pick... and what happens when you always change your original pick. The experimental probability of winning the car is calculated for you after every round. Make sure to reset the game before changing strategies.</p>
